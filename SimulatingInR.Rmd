# Simulation

## Recap

Discussion of: sample(), rnorm(), runif(), etc. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(2001)

## Simulating "coin flips"
sample(x=c("H", "T"), size=4, replace=TRUE)
rbinom(n=4, size=1, prob=0.5)

## Simulating "heights"
rnorm(n=10, mean=165, sd=5)
runif(n=10, min=160, max=180)

```



## Exercise: Creating a Tibble

Let's build a dataset/tibble that is about my experiences waiting for the bus. It will include how early/late the bus was (waiting_time), the colour of my shirt the day I was waiting  and the number of people also waiting at the bus stop.

```{r}
set.seed(2023)

waiting_times <- runif(n=10, min=-1, max=4)

shirt_colour <- sample(x=colour, size=10, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.6, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1))

num_peeps_bus <- rpois(n=10, lambda = 3)

my_bus_data <- tibble(waiting_times, shirt_colour, num_peeps_bus)

glimpse(my_bus_data)
```
